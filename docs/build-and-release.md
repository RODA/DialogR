# Build And Release

DialogR owns its public build entry points. DialogForge is used as the shared
engine.

Start with the canonical DialogForge product-authoring manual:

```text
DialogForge/internal/product-authoring.md
```

## Local Builds

Use a sibling checkout by default:

```text
<workspace>/DialogForge
<workspace>/DialogR
```

Then run commands from the DialogR repository:

```sh
npm start
npm run check
npm run build
npm run build -- --sign
```

`npm start` builds and launches DialogR in Electron development mode with
DevTools open. It watches product files, restaging and restarting the
application when they change. It uses the sibling DialogForge checkout by
default. For another location, either set `DIALOGFORGE_ROOT` or pass it
explicitly:

```sh
npm start -- --forge-path /path/to/DialogForge
```

`npm run build` uses the current host OS. On macOS, the default build is
ad-hoc signed so the app bundle remains valid without private signing
credentials. Use `--sign` only when a maintainer intentionally wants Developer
ID signing and has a valid signing identity.

The compiled desktop application is staged in the product repository under
`dist/`. Installers, update metadata, and other release artifacts are written
under `build/output/`.

Release repositories are inferred or optionally configured, but release tags are
required product settings in `package.json > product.releaseTags`. In DialogR,
the current values are `linuxIntel=li`, `windowsIntel=wi`, `macosIntel=mi`,
`macosSilicon=ms`, and `webrVFS=web`. Treat these as repo-specific examples
for this product; other products or forks can use different values.

DialogR's WebR VFS is owned by the `web` release in `RODA/DialogR`. Product
builds and the `webr:library` command must use that release directly.

Set `DIALOGFORGE_ROOT` when DialogForge is not a sibling checkout.

## CI Builds

`.github/workflows/build.yml` builds Linux, Windows, and macOS artifacts from
the DialogR repository.

## Pre-release Gate

Run the complete production verification before calling a revision
release-ready:

```sh
npm run verify:production
```

This is deliberately stronger than source and contract tests. It runs the
product check with an explicit DialogForge root, builds the production
artifacts, launches the packaged Electron application, verifies that the
packaged Script Editor can initialize native Live Script sharing and enables
both collaboration controls, and exercises the compiled web application.

Use `--skip-build` only when verifying the exact artifacts that will be
published. A local macOS pass does not certify Windows or Linux. Every CI build
lane runs the packaged Script Editor and Live Script smoke on its own target
platform before an artifact can be uploaded or sent for signing.
The maintainer-only macOS publisher repeats that smoke against the stapled
application before it changes the GitHub release.
